## Key Features

- **Type-Safe Port System:**
  Supports a rich set of port types including primitives (string, number, boolean) and complex types (arrays, objects, streams, enums). Each port is defined with its own configuration and runtime validation (via Zod and SuperJSON) and employs both lazy instantiation and caching for optimal memory usage.

- **Modular and Extensible Nodes:**
  Create custom nodes using decorators and metadata. Nodes feature multiple input and output ports and integrate seamlessly into the flow builder, enabling rapid development of complex workflows.

- **Visual Flow Editor:**
  Build flows graphically with a React- and XYFlow-based frontend. Enjoy features like drag-and-drop layout, zoom and pan, resizing, contextual menus, and live previews.

- **Robust Execution Engine & Debugging Tools:**
  A backend execution engine supports concurrent execution of flows with real-time event subscriptions, plus debugging features such as breakpoints, step-over, and detailed event logging for effective troubleshooting.

- **Real-Time Synchronization & Optimistic Updates:**
  Integrated with tRPC and Effector for end-to-end type safety, the system provides real-time updates (via WebSockets) and supports optimistic UI updatesâ€”ensuring an interactive and responsive user experience.

- **Docker and Cloud Compatibility:**
  Easily build, deploy, and scale both the backend and frontend using Docker and docker-compose. Containerized deployment simplifies the setup process and enhances portability.

## Architecture & Technologies

ChainGraph is built with modern web technologies, aiming at a robust and type-safe development experience:

- **TypeScript:**
  Uses advanced TypeScript features (generics, decorators, conditional types) for compile-time safety and robustness.

- **Effector:**
  A reactive state management library that powers both frontend and backend state handling and simplifies the implementation of optimistic updates and subscriptions.

- **tRPC:**
  Facilitates end-to-end type-safe API communication between the frontend and backend, minimizing runtime errors and ensuring consistency in data handling.

- **Zod & SuperJSON:**
  Zod is used for runtime schema validation, while SuperJSON manages complex data serialization, ensuring that data remains consistent across the client and server boundaries.

- **XYFlow:**
  A visual flow library used on the frontend to render and manage the drag-and-drop canvas, enabling users to compose workflows visually.

- **WebSockets:**
  Real-time subscriptions using WebSocket (via tRPC's adapter) keep the client in constant sync with backend state and execution events.

## Getting Started

ChainGraph provides a complete development environment with hot module reloading, integrated testing, and containerized deployment options. This guide covers local installation and Docker-based setups.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/badaitech/chaingraph.git
cd chaingraph
pnpm install
```

## Running in Development Mode

To start the development environment (both frontend and backend), run:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This command launches:

- The frontend development server (with hot reloading)
- The backend development process (watch mode)

You can also run each package individually if desired:

- **Backend:**
  `pnpm run dev:back`
- **Frontend:**
  `pnpm run dev:front`

## PostgreSQL Database Storage

ChainGraph can be configured to use PostgreSQL for persistent storage instead of the default in-memory storage solution. Follow these steps to set up database storage:

### 1. Start PostgreSQL Database

Use the included Docker Compose configuration to start a PostgreSQL database:

```bash
docker compose up -d postgres
```

This will start a PostgreSQL instance accessible on port 5432.

### 2. Configure Database Connection

Create a `.env` file in the project root with your database connection parameters based on the provided `.env.example`:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable
```

### 3. Run Database Migrations

Before starting ChainGraph with PostgreSQL storage, you need to run migrations to create the necessary database schema:

```bash
pnpm run migrate
```

This command will create all required tables and indexes in your PostgreSQL database.

### 4. Start ChainGraph with Database Storage

Once migrations are complete, you can start ChainGraph as usual. It will automatically detect and use the PostgreSQL database for persistent storage:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

With this configuration, your flows, nodes, and execution data will be stored persistently in PostgreSQL instead of being lost when the server restarts.

## Building for Production

To build the entire project, execute:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can also build specific packages:

```bash
# Build frontend only
pnpm run build:front

# Build backend only
pnpm run build:back
```

To preview the production build:

```bash
pnpm run preview
```

## Docker & Docker-compose

ChainGraph can also be built and run using Docker. The repository includes Dockerfiles for both the backend and frontend, along with a docker-compose configuration for orchestrating the containers.

### Building Docker Images

You can build Docker images for individual components using the Makefile targets:

- **Build backend image:**

  ```bash
  make docker-build-backend
  ```

- **Build frontend image:**

  ```bash
  make docker-build-frontend
  ```

- **Build both images:**

  ```bash
  make docker-build-all
  ```

Alternatively, you can build them manually using Docker commands. For example, to build the backend image manually use:

```bash
docker build -t chaingraph-backend -f apps/chaingraph-backend/Dockerfile .
```

And likewise for the frontend:

```bash
docker build -t chaingraph-frontend -f apps/chaingraph-frontend/Dockerfile .
```

### Running with Docker-compose

Use docker-compose to launch both containers concurrently. In the repository root, run:

```bash
make docker-compose-up
```

This command will start the backend on port 3001 and the frontend (serving on port 80 inside the container, mapped to 5173 on your host). To stop and remove containers, run:

```bash
make docker-compose-down
```

You can also run these commands manually:

```bash
docker-compose up -d      # Start containers in the background
docker-compose down       # Stop and remove containers
```
