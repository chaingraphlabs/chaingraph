A powerful, React-based visual programming interface for the ChainGraph flow-based programming framework. This package provides a complete, feature-rich UI for designing, managing, and executing computational graphs with a focus on real-time collaboration and type safety.

## Features

- **Visual Flow Editor**: Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for designing computational flows
- **Real-time Synchronization**: WebSocket-based updates ensure all changes are immediately reflected
- **Type-Safe Ports**: Strong type checking for node connections with visual feedback
- **Interactive Debugging**: Debug mode with breakpoints, step execution, and visual state tracking
- **Theming Support**: Built-in light and dark mode with customizable node styling
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and resolutions
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient rendering even with large and complex flows

## Installation

```bash
# Before installing, make sure you have set up authentication for GitHub Packages
npm install @badaitech/chaingraph-frontend
# or
yarn add @badaitech/chaingraph-frontend
# or
pnpm add @badaitech/chaingraph-frontend
```

## Authentication for GitHub Packages

To use this package, you need to configure npm to authenticate with GitHub Packages:

1. Create a personal access token (PAT) with the `read:packages` scope on GitHub.
2. Add the following to your project's `.npmrc` file or to your global `~/.npmrc` file:

```
@badaitech:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_GITHUB_PAT
```

Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_PAT` with your actual GitHub personal access token.

## Basic Usage

To integrate the ChainGraph editor into your React application:

```tsx
import {Flow} from '@badaitech/chaingraph-frontend';
import {TrpcProvider} from '@badaitech/chaingraph-trpc/client';
import {ThemeProvider, ZoomProvider, DndProvider} from '@badaitech/chaingraph-frontend/providers';
import {ReactFlowProvider} from '@xyflow/react';

function App() {
    return (
        <RootProvider
            trpcURL={`ws://localhost:3001`}
            superjsonCustom={SuperJSON}
            nodeRegistry={NodeRegistry.getInstance()}
        >
            <div className="flex h-screen">
                <Sidebar
                    onFlowSelected={(flowId) => {
                        // For example, navigate to the selected flow
                        // navigate(`/flow/${flowId}`)
                    }}
                    enabledTabs={[
                        'flows', 
                        'nodes', 
                        'events', 
                        'variables', 
                        'debug', 
                        'settings', 
                        'help'
                    ]}
                />
                <div className="flex-1">
                    <Flow
                        {/* Flow id is optional */}
                        flowId={'your-flow-id'}
                    />
                </div>
            </div>
        </RootProvider>
    );
}

export default App;
```

## Key Concepts

### Flows

Flows are computational graphs made up of nodes and connections. Each flow can be created, saved, executed, and shared. The ChainGraph frontend provides a complete management system for flows with operations like:

- Creating and editing flows
- Managing flow metadata (name, description, tags)
- Executing flows with real-time monitoring
- Debugging with breakpoints and step execution

### Nodes

Nodes are the building blocks of a flow. Each node has:

- Input and output ports with type definitions
- Configuration options
- Visual styling based on category
- Execution state indicators

### Ports

Ports represent data inputs and outputs for nodes. The frontend supports:

- Various port types (string, number, boolean, array, object, stream)
- Type-safe connections between ports
- Rich editing capabilities for different data types
- Visual indicators for connection status

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v22.x or higher
- pnpm v10.x or higher

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/badaitech/chaingraph.git
cd chaingraph

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the frontend development server
pnpm --filter @badaitech/chaingraph-frontend run dev
```

### Building

```bash
# Build the frontend package
pnpm --filter @badaitech/chaingraph-frontend run build
```

## Component Structure

The frontend is organized into several key component areas:

- **Flow**: The main canvas component for visualizing and interacting with flows
- **Sidebar**: Navigation and management interface with tabs for flows, nodes, and settings
- **Nodes**: Visual representations of computational units with configurable ports
- **Controls**: UI elements for flow execution, debugging, and management

## Theming

ChainGraph frontend supports both light and dark themes out of the box. The theme can be toggled with the `ThemeToggle` component or programmatically via the `ThemeProvider`.

```tsx
import { useTheme } from '@badaitech/chaingraph-frontend';

function MyComponent() {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useTheme();
  
  return (
    <button onClick={toggleTheme}>
      Current theme: {theme}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Advanced Usage

### Flow Subscription

The frontend automatically synchronizes with the backend using WebSocket subscriptions:

```tsx
import { useFlowSubscription } from '@badaitech/chaingraph-frontend';

function FlowSyncStatus() {
  const { status, isSubscribed, error } = useFlowSubscription();
  
  return (
    <div>
      Connection status: {status}
      {error && <div>Error: {error.message}</div>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Execution Control

Control flow execution with the built-in hooks:

```tsx
import { 
  createExecution, 
  startExecution, 
  pauseExecution,
  stepExecution
} from '@badaitech/chaingraph-frontend';
import { useUnit } from 'effector-react';
import { $executionState } from '@badaitech/chaingraph-frontend';

function ExecutionControls() {
  const { executionId, status, debugMode } = useUnit($executionState);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => createExecution({ flowId: 'your-flow-id', debug: true })}>
        Create Execution
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => startExecution(executionId)}>
        Start
      </button>
      {/* Other execution controls */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Browser Compatibility

ChainGraph frontend is compatible with modern browsers including:
- Chrome/Edge (latest 2 versions)
- Firefox (latest 2 versions)

Safari needs to investigate some issues.
Internet Explorer is not supported.
