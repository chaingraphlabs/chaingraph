/**
 * DBOS Child Spawner Queue - Special task queue for spawning child executions
 *
 * This queue uses DBOS messaging (DBOS.send) instead of DBOS.startWorkflow,
 * allowing child executions to be spawned from within steps (where startWorkflow is not allowed).
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - Parent execution (in step) calls publishTask()
 * - This sends message to 'child-spawner' workflow via DBOS.send()
 * - Child spawner workflow receives message and starts child workflow
 * - Child workflow runs independently
 *
 * Benefits:
 * - âš¡ Blazing fast: DBOS.send() is just a DB write (~1-2ms)
 * - ðŸš€ Non-blocking: Parent doesn't wait for child to start
 * - âœ… Allowed: DBOS.send() works from steps
 * - ðŸ’¾ Durable: Messages stored in PostgreSQL
 * - ðŸ”„ Reliable: Guaranteed delivery
