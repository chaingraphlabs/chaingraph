/**
 * Child Spawner Workflow - Dedicated workflow for spawning child executions
 *
 * This workflow runs continuously and receives child execution tasks via DBOS messaging.
 * It's responsible for starting child workflows, which allows parent executions (running in steps)
 * to spawn children without violating DBOS constraints.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * ```
 * Parent Execution (in step):
 *   â†’ EventEmitter node executes
 *   â†’ context.emitEvent('event-name', data)
 *   â†’ ExecutionService.processEmittedEvents()
 *   â†’ DBOS.send('child-spawner', childTask, 'CHILD_TASKS')  âš¡ Fast!
 *   â†’ Parent continues execution (non-blocking)
 *
 * Child Spawner Workflow (separate workflow):
 *   â†’ while(true):
 *       â†’ childTask = DBOS.recv('CHILD_TASKS', timeout)
 *       â†’ if (childTask):
 *           â†’ DBOS.startWorkflow(executionWorkflow, {workflowID: childTask.executionId})(childTask)
 *           â†’ Child workflow starts immediately
 * ```
 *
 * Benefits:
 * - âš¡ Blazing fast: DBOS.send() is just a DB write (~1-2ms)
 * - ðŸš€ Non-blocking: Parent doesn't wait for child to start
 * - âœ… Allowed: DBOS.send() works from steps
 * - ðŸ’¾ Durable: Messages stored in PostgreSQL
 * - ðŸ”„ Reliable: Guaranteed delivery
 * - ðŸ“ˆ Scalable: One spawner handles all child executions
 *
 * The spawner workflow ID is 'child-spawner' (singleton)

 * Child spawner workflow function

 * This workflow runs continuously, receiving child execution tasks and starting them.

 * If the system restarts, DBOS automatically recovers this workflow and it resumes receiving tasks.
