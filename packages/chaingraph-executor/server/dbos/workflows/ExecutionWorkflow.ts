/**
 * Main DBOS workflow for executing chaingraph flows
 *
 * This workflow orchestrates the execution of a chaingraph flow in three durable steps:
 * 1. Mark execution as "running" (checkpoint)
 * 2. Execute flow atomically: load + execute + stream events (checkpoint)
 * 3. Mark execution as "completed" (checkpoint)
 *
 * DBOS Durability Guarantees:
 * - Each step is checkpointed in PostgreSQL
 * - If the worker crashes, DBOS automatically resumes from the last completed step
 * - If Step 1 completes but Step 2 crashes, DBOS will retry Step 2 on another worker
 * - The workflow is guaranteed to run to completion (at-least-once semantics)
 * - Idempotency is ensured through workflow ID (executionId)
 *
 * Recovery Example:
 * ```
 * Time 0: Step 1 completes (status = running) âœ“
 * Time 1: Step 2 starts (executing flow)
 * Time 2: Worker crashes ðŸ’¥
 * Time 3: DBOS detects incomplete workflow
 * Time 4: DBOS retries Step 2 on another worker â†»
 * Time 5: Step 2 completes âœ“
 * Time 6: Step 3 completes (status = completed) âœ“
 * ```
